> This repository contains code examples for the types of implementations for Singleton Pattern

| S.No |  Pattern  | Pros |  Cons   |  When to use?   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 1 | [EagerInitialization](src/main/java/surya/learns/designpatterns/singleton/EagerInitializedSingleton.java) | Very simple to implement  |    1) May lead to resource wastage. Because instance of class is created always, whether it is required or not. 2) CPU time is also wasted in creation of instance if it is not required. 3) Exception handling is not possible. | 
| 2 | [Static Block]()
